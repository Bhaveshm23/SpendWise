### High-Level Diagram


### Key Components:
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Developed in JavaScript for a seamless user experience.
2. **Backend**: 
   - Flask application that calls AWS API Gateway to trigger Lambda Functions interacting with DynamoDB and S3.
3. **Cloud Services**:
   - **AWS Cognito**: Handles authentication.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Contains core business logic.
   - **API Gateway**: Routes API requests securely.
   - **DynamoDB**: Stores user and bill data.
   - **S3**: Stores uploaded bill images and profile pictures.
   - **SES**: Sends financial reports to users.

## Testing Procedures


### Integration Testing

## Lambda Function Testing

### Testing Tools
- AWS Lambda Test Events
- CloudWatch Logs

### Test Scenarios
1. **Bill Upload Lambda**
   - Verify file processing
   - Check data extraction accuracy
   - Test error handling

2. **User Authentication Lambda**
   - Validate token generation
   - Test user registration flow
   - Check permission handling

### Sample Test Event
```json
{
  "user_id": "test_user",
  "file_content": "base64_encoded_bill_image",
  "file_type": "pdf"
}
```

## API Gateway Testing

### Testing Approach
- Postman/curl for API endpoint verification
- Manual API endpoint testing

### Key Endpoints to Test
- `/upload`
- `/savebill`
- `/home/`
- `/export/daterange`

### Test Cases
1. **Successful Requests**
   - Validate response structure
   - Check status codes
   - Verify data integrity

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Invalid authentication
   - Malformed requests
   - Permission issues


## Monitoring and Logging
- Use CloudWatch for lambda function logs
- Set up detailed error tracking
- Monitor API Gateway request/response cycles



### Future Roadmap

- Implement machine learning for spending predictions
- Enhanced data visualization
- Allow users to update their profile
